# dockerfiles
A collection of useful dockerfiles
___
_Inspired by @jfrazelle's awesome repo: https://github.com/jfrazelle/dockerfiles_

These are dockerfiles for individual programs that I might want to run in their own container. Why? The isolation is nice,
but its also a great way to make these programs "portable" across systems. _(I'm doing this to see if its a superior way
to do what I'm doing with my dotfiles repo.)_
